# Energy-Management-System-for-Parallel-Mild-Hybrid-Electric-Vehicle

The stringent emission norms have forced automobile manufacturers to shift to alternative sources like Hybrid Electric Vehicles or Fully Electric Vehicles. 
Until the full market switch to Fully Electric Mobility, 
Hybrid Electric Vehicles proves to be a promising 
solution with a sustainable and cleaner environment 
through a reduction in emission and reduced fossil fuel 
consumption. The increased optimized efficiency 
requirements have led to the development of various 
Energy management Strategies. This paper focuses on the 
Rule-based energy management technique and its 
implementation on a typical Parallel Hybrid Vehicle 
(Mercedes- Benz A-Class 170 CDI). The strategy is used 
for optimizing the fuel consumption for the New 
European Driving Cycle (NEDC) which is widely used in 
Europe and the Federal Test Procedure (FTP- 75) from 
the Environmental Protection Agency used in the United 
States of America. MATLAB and QSS Simulink toolbox 
are the tools used in the development process. Simulation 
results illustrate an approximately 23.29 % efficiency 
improvement in fuel consumption maintaining low 
deviations from the initial state of charge (SOC).
